# PPR Drawing Robot

This project is about creating a PPR robot simulation, a CNC drawing robot, with a URDF file for visual and collision representation in MATLAB. The STL file for the robot has been edited using Blender.

PPR Drawing Robot after adding the STL files


## Prerequisites

To work on this project, you will need:

- MATLAB with the Robotics System Toolbox installed
- A 3D model of the PPR robot in STL format, edited using Blender
- Basic knowledge of the URDF file format and how to use it in MATLAB
- Blender installed on your computer for editing the STL file

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Open the `ppr_drawing_robot.mlx` LiveScript in MATLAB
3. Follow the instructions in the LiveScript to create the URDF file for the PPR robot and add the STL file for visual representation
4. Test the resulting URDF file by loading it into a robot object in MATLAB and displaying it in the robot viewer

## Customization

You can customize the PPR robot by modifying the URDF file and STL file as needed. For example, you may want to change the dimensions of the robot or add additional joints and links. You can use Blender to edit the STL file as needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while working on this project, please make sure that you have all of the prerequisites installed and that you are following the instructions in the `ppr_drawing_robot.mlx` LiveScript correctly. If you continue to have problems, you can try searching online for solutions or reaching out to the community for help.
